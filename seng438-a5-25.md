## **3 Plots for MTTFmin, Half and Twice**

### **MTTFmin**

This image shows the plot for MTTFmin. MTTFmin was derived through trial and error and was calculated to be 100 / 132000 = 0.00076. While a majority of the points intially fall in the reject range, this MTTF value allows the system to just barely pass the acceptance threshold.

### **Half MTTFmin**

This image shows the plot for 1/2 * MTTFmin. Given MTTFmin, this half amount was calculated to be 50 / 132000 = 0.00039. It can be seen that with this value as the MTTF, all data points fall in the rejection area which aligns with the changes as the number of allowed failures was reduced

### **Double MTTFmin**

This image shows the plot for 2 * MTTFmin. GIven MTTFmin, this doubled amount was calculated to be 200 / 132000 = 0.0015. It can be seen that with this value as the MTTF, all a majority of the data points fall in the acceptance area with a small intial set of data falling in the continue range. This aligns with the changes as the number of allowed failures was increased

## **Evaluation and Justification of MTTFmin**
As seen in the first graph above, the MTTFmin we decided on was 100 / 132000 = 0.00076. This value was found through the process of trial and error of trying various values until the last point on the graph just barely entered the acceptance region. The calculation for MTTFmin represents a ratio -- 100 maximum failures per 132000 input events. While experimenting with MTTF values, we saw that smaller MTTF values resulted in the points shifting more to the left, towards the rejection region while larger MTTF values resulted in the points shifting further to the right, towards the acceptance region. To determine MTTFmin, we decided to leave the risk trade-off parameters as their default values.

## **Advantages and Disadvantages of RDC**
**Advantages**
- In theory, this provides a low cost method for calculating and determining system reliabiity as no complicated software is required.
- Low cost attribute can also aid in a faster decisions as visuals can quickly determine if the product should be tested further/

**Disadvantage**
- Viewing a visual in the form of a graph may not provide the most precise form of tracking these metrics. 
- Playing around with MTTFmin to meet RDC criteria and create a graph that made sense required a lot of trial-and-error/guess-and-check work
